# Ark
I Introduction/Background
This project is based on below two assumptions:
a.	Humans are dual beings which means they exist in another reality as a ‘Soul’. Souls connect with the physical body via an invisible body through which energies transmitted to the brains, heart and areas in the spine, hence control the body and its functions, experience the reality on Earth.*
b.	Planet Earth is a prison for Souls.
II Objectives
Project Ark aims to create a universal movement to liberate Souls by providing methods and tools to gain self-knowledge and self-consciousness.
IV Scope of Work
V Deliverables
a. Freedom
